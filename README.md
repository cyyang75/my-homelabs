# My Cybersecurity Homelabs

### I have built my own in-house cybersecurity homelab to simulate different components of a business network. It provides me with a practical environment for configuring, securing, and monitoring an IT infrastructure using various industry tools. This allows me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.

### I consistently practice in my homelabs to gain hands-on experience and ensure continuous improvement. 

### These are some of the commonly used software tools I work with in these labs: Wireshark, Nmap, Snort, Metasploit, Kali Linux, Burp Suite, Splunk, OpenVAS, Hashcat, OSSEC, John the Ripper, Tenable Nessus.

### This is a recent lab I completed:

Lab Components:

- pfSense firewall for perimeter defense

- Security Onion IDS for intrusion detection

- Kali Linux for attack simulation

- Windows Server as an Active Directory domain controller

- Splunk for log management

- Various Linux machines for testing vulnerabilities

Tools:

- Attacker: Kali Linux

- Firewall: pfSense

- IDS: Security Onion

- SIEM: Splunk

- Hypervisor: VMware/VirtualBox

- Domain Controller: Windows Active Directory

- Vulnerable Machines: Ubuntu, Windows, DVWA, VulnHub machines

#### This homelab setup has greatly enhanced my hands-on skills and prepared me for real-world scenarios in the field of cybersecurity.

### Below are some cybersecurity homelab projects I have completed, am currently working on, or plan to work on, all tailored to my goal of becoming an entry-level Security Analyst, SOC Analyst, or Incident Handler:

1. Network Monitoring Lab (SOC Simulation)

   - Tools: Security Onion, Splunk, ELK Stack

   - Focus: Set up a network using virtual machines (VMs) and configure tools like Security Onion or Splunk to monitor network traffic and generate alerts. I practice responding to simulated attacks or suspicious behavior, using tools to analyze logs, network traffic (Wireshark), and events.

2. Incident Response Lab

   - Tools: Volatility, Autopsy, SIFT Workstation

   - Focus: Set up a virtual environment, simulate a security breach (e.g., phishing attack or malware infection), and go through the incident response process. This includes identifying compromised machines, analyzing malware, and conducting forensic analysis using memory and disk analysis tools.

3. Firewall and IDS/IPS Lab

   - Tools: pfSense, Snort, Suricata

   - Focus: Set up a virtual firewall using pfSense and configure IDS/IPS systems like Snort or Suricata. I test the system by running various attacks (e.g., port scans, DDoS) and analyze how the IDS/IPS detects and logs these incidents.

4. Malware Analysis Lab

   - Tools: REMnux, Cuckoo Sandbox, IDA Free, Ghidra

   - Focus: Create a safe, isolated VM environment to analyze malware samples. I use Cuckoo Sandbox to automate the analysis and Ghidra or IDA Free to reverse-engineer malware, helping me understand how it operates and spreads.

5. SIEM Integration Lab

   - Tools: Splunk, Graylog, Elastic Stack

   - Focus: I simulate real-time logging and monitoring of security events by integrating a SIEM platform. Using a Windows Server VM or Linux system as the log source, I generate traffic and write queries or dashboards to analyze logs and respond to incidents.

6. Vulnerability Scanning and Management Lab

   - Tools: OpenVAS, Nessus, Metasploit

   - Focus: I use vulnerability scanners to identify weaknesses in my lab network, follow up by using Metasploit to exploit vulnerabilities, and then apply patches or mitigations. I also practice reporting findings and understanding the patch management process.

7. Log Analysis and Threat Hunting Lab

   - Tools: Sysmon, Winlogbeat, Elasticsearch, Kibana

   - Focus: I install Sysmon on a Windows VM to generate detailed event logs, use Winlogbeat to ship the logs to Elasticsearch, and visualize them with Kibana. I analyze logs for signs of compromise or suspicious activity, practicing threat-hunting techniques.

8. Phishing Simulation Lab

   - Tools: Gophish, SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)

   - Focus: I simulate phishing campaigns using Gophish and capture data to understand the techniques used in social engineering attacks. I also test detection and mitigation strategies by setting up email filtering systems or educating users.

9. Digital Forensics Lab

   - Tools: Autopsy, FTK Imager, Bulk Extractor

   - Focus: I simulate a cybercrime investigation using forensic tools to analyze disk images and extract evidence. I practice identifying malicious files, constructing timelines of attacks, and understanding key forensic indicators.

10. Packet Capture and Analysis Lab

   - Tools: Wireshark, tcpdump, Zeek (formerly Bro)

   - Focus: I capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark or Zeek. I simulate various attacks (e.g., ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning) and analyze network traffic to understand patterns and detect malicious behavior.
